# Unity Blender Controller

Unity Blender-Style Transform Plugin


# Overview

This Unity plugin aims to bring Blender-style transform controls to Unity, providing users with a familiar and intuitive way to manipulate objects within the scene. Inspired by Blender's 'G,S,R'  functionality, our plugin enables users to easily move, rotate, and scale objects using a similar workflow.
